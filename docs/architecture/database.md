There are some tables in the database that are not needed because they are not used in any part of the code base.
The next version of GovtPortal will resolved that so that the Database will be properly documented.

## Schema

The data base schema can be downloaded [here](../../static/files/ippayware_main.sql)

:::danger No Entity Relationship Diagram
Unfortunately We cannot generate an ER Diagram at the moment. The relations have not been created from the start of the project
